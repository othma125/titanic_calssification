# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project is focused on predicting the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. Two models are implemented: Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various features of the passengers like Age, Sex, Passenger Class (Pclass), and Fare. The data is split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
## Output
The program will generate two CSV files with survival predictions:

logistic_regression_result.csv
random_forest_result.csv

## Installation
To run this project, you need to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python titanic.py
